					<description><![CDATA[Dear Fraser,

I was wondering if it would be possible to share a link to your dissertation in our E-Bulletin on Friday. This bulletin goes out to 780 individuals who are interested in independent advocacy and issues which affect vulnerable people...self directed support being one of those issues. 

Kind regards,
