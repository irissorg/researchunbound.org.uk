								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Venue: Scottish Universities Insight Institute, Collins Building, 22 Richmond Street, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, G1 1XQ</p>
<p>Time: 09h30 to 16h30</p>
<p>This workshop &#8211; the third in the series &#8211; will review the findings of the first two workshops in the light of the Scottish Government&#8217;s housing strategic outcomes and well-being agenda. We will explore what the ‘well-being and home’ and ‘well-being and neighbourhood’ workshop sessions have told us about the importance of home.</p>
<p>Invited respondents who have not previously been involved in the project will reflect on our findings to stimulate a discussion about how we can use a deeper understanding of home to influence the well-being policy agenda.</p>
<p>To help our thinking we have invited Justin Gleeson from AIRO, Maynooth University in the Republic of Ireland to share with us some of his data visualisation methods on housing and social welfare issues in Dublin.</p>
<p>We are keen that as many different people, professions and interested parties join us.</p>
<p>Attendance is free and lunch will be provided.</p>
<p>Please do ensure that you <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/home-not-housing-seminar-3-tickets-13347732427">register to attend </a>the session.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The theme of the second event in the Home not Housing series is <em><strong>Time and Place</strong></em></p>
<p>We will explore the linkages between home and the neighbourhood in order to better understand how the wider environment impacts and shapes our sense of home and wellbeing.</p>
<p>We are really keen to engage with a wide range of community and professional interests since, as the first session revealed, home is more than just physical housing.</p>
<p>Spaces are limited so please <a title="Online booking form for Time and Place 8 July" href="http://www.scottishinsight.ac.uk/Programmes/Wellbeing2014/HomenotHousing/Seminar2.aspx">book your place</a>.</p>
