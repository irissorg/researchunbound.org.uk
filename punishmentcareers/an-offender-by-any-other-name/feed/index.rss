					<description><![CDATA[Thanks Claire, I agree with you about the tagline - it seems to presuppose the findings. In my PhD research I had a lot of findings that chime with what you describe as the second sentence: even the long-term prisoners who wanted to turn their life around found it hard because there were no opportunities for them to, for example, get a job.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Really interested to read more about your research Marguerite.  

I find your notion of persistent punishment clear but having a title around &quot;The meaning of&quot; perhaps implies there is one meaning?  Is it more meanings of, or experiences of?  

This also made me reflect on a discussion at an event about distant voices facilitated by Vox Liminis, for further info see http://blogs.iriss.org.uk/voxliminis/.  Here we started to explore the concept of the second sentence imposed by society, in this case following release from prison.  Very different discussion but I thought it might be of interest.]]></description>
