					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] Several women who stopped taking drugs and offending when they found themselves pregnant and managed to sustain a crime- and drug-free lifestyle for several years while their child was young. Having social work contact from birth (due to their drug taking), though, meant that when they relapsed their child was taken away from them (often to go and live with family members), with little of no hope of them being returned. To cope with their sense of failure and missing their child these women turned back to drugs and offending, serving further sentences (see also imprisonment as the aftermath).

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks Claire, I agree with you about the tagline - it seems to presuppose the findings. In my PhD research I had a lot of findings that chime with what you describe as the second sentence: even the long-term prisoners who wanted to turn their life around found it hard because there were no opportunities for them to, for example, get a job.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Really interested to read more about your research Marguerite.  

I find your notion of persistent punishment clear but having a title around &quot;The meaning of&quot; perhaps implies there is one meaning?  Is it more meanings of, or experiences of?  

This also made me reflect on a discussion at an event about distant voices facilitated by Vox Liminis, for further info see http://blogs.iriss.org.uk/voxliminis/.  Here we started to explore the concept of the second sentence imposed by society, in this case following release from prison.  Very different discussion but I thought it might be of interest.]]></description>
